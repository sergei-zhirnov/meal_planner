<h2>Boxes are not just objects!</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p><p>You were asked to help with Java programming in a company that makes boxes. Their former Java programmer created a Box class that uses objects and requires casting. Now everyone knows that casting is slow and error-prone and that is why the programmer got fired. Now your job is to create Box implementation that will not require casting but provide type-checking at compile time.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>
