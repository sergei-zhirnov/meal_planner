<h2>The Map interface</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>In some situations, you need to store pairs of associated objects. For example, when counting the number of words in a text, the first one is a word, and the second one is the number of its occurrences in the text. There is a special type of collection called <strong>map</strong> to effectively store such pairs of objects.</p>

The key is similar to an index in an array, and the value is the data that is retrieved when the key is used to access it. Key-value pairs are useful in situations where you need to store and retrieve data using a unique identifier. For example, in a phone book, the unique identifier (key) is the name of the contact, and the value associated with that key is the phone number.">key-value pairs</a></u>. Keys are always unique, while values can repeat.</p><p></p></div>
<p></p>
<p>A good example of a map from the real world is a phone book where keys are names of your friends and values are phone numbers associated with them.</p>

<p>Maps have some similarities with <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/36432" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a set is a collection of unique elements, similar to a mathematical set. | It is fundamentally different from arrays or lists because it is not possible to access an element by its index. Sets are used when you need to keep only unique elements within a collection, get rid of duplicates in a sequence, or perform mathematical operations. The Java Collection Framework provides the Set interface to represent a set as an abstract data type. Some commonly used set implementations include HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet, which are mutable and have different rules for ordering elements and are optimized for different types of operations. Immutable sets, whose names are not important for programmers, also implement the Set interface.">sets</a> and arrays;</p>

The `int` type can store numbers within a certain range, while `long` can store a wider range of numbers. You can perform various arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus with variables of integer types. Java also allows the use of the underscore character to separate groups of digits within a number for better readability.">integer numbers</a>, strings and so on.</p></li></ul>
<p>Due to these reasons, you can encounter some kind of <em>deja vu</em> effect when learning maps.</p>
<p>Next, all our examples will use string and numbers as keys since using custom classes as types of keys have some significant points the same as for sets. It will be considered in other topics.</p>
<h5 id="the-map-interface">The Map interface</h5>
<p><strong><em>The Collections Framework</em></strong> provides the <code class="language-java">Map&lt;K,V&gt;</code> interface to represent a <strong>map</strong> as an abstract data type. Here, <code class="language-java">K</code> is a type of keys, and <code class="language-java">V</code> is a type of associated values. The <code class="language-java">Map</code> interface is not a subtype of the <code class="language-java">Collection</code> interface, but maps are often considered as collections since they are part of the framework.</p>
<p>The interface declares a lot of methods to work with maps. Some of the methods are similar to methods of <code class="language-java">Collection</code>, while others are unique to maps.</p>
<p><strong>1) Collection-like methods:</strong></p>
<ul><li><p><code class="language-java">int size()</code> returns the number of elements in the map;</p></li><li><p><code class="language-java">boolean isEmpty()</code> returns <code class="language-java">true</code> if the map does not contain elements and <code class="language-java">false</code> otherwise;</p></li><li><p><code class="language-java">void clear()</code> removes all elements from the map.</p></li></ul>
<p>We hope these methods do not need any comments.</p>
<p><strong>2) Keys and values processing:</strong></p>
<ul><li><p><code class="language-java">V put(K key, V value)</code> associates the specified <code class="language-java">value</code> with the specified <code class="language-java">key</code> and returns the previously associated value with this <code class="language-java">key</code> or <code class="language-java">null</code>;</p></li><li><p><code class="language-java">V get(Object key)</code> returns the value associated with the key, or <code class="language-java">null</code> otherwise;</p></li><li><p><code class="language-java">V remove(Object key)</code> removes the mapping for a <code class="language-java">key</code> from the map;</p></li><li><p><code class="language-java">boolean containsKey(Object key)</code>  returns <code class="language-java">true</code> if the map contains the specified <code class="language-java">key</code>;</p></li><li><p><code class="language-java">boolean containsValue(Object value)</code> returns <code class="language-java">true</code> if the map contains the specified <code class="language-java">value</code>.</p></li></ul>
<p>These methods are similar to the methods of collections, except they process key-value pairs.</p>
<p><strong>3) Advanced methods:</strong></p>
<ul><li><p><code class="language-java">V putIfAbsent(K key, V value)</code> puts a pair if the specified key is not already associated with a value (or is mapped to <code class="language-java">null</code>) and <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10982" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a return is a statement that ends the execution of a method and specifies a value to be returned to the caller. | The return type of a method defines what type of value can be returned. If a method has a return type of void, it means that the method does not return any value. However, you can still use the return statement to exit the method. If a method with a void return type tries to return a value, a compile error will occur.">return</a> <code class="language-java">null</code>, otherwise, returns the current value;</p></li><li><p><code class="language-java">V getOrDefault(Object key, V defaultValue)</code> returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or <code class="language-java">defaultValue</code> if this map contains no mapping for the key.</p></li></ul>
<p>These methods, together with some others, are often used in real projects.</p>
<p><strong>4) Methods which return other collections:</strong></p>
<ul><li><p><code class="language-java">Set&lt;K&gt; keySet()</code> Returns a <code class="language-java">Set</code> view of the keys contained in this map;</p></li><li><p><code class="language-java">Collection&lt;V&gt; values() </code>returns a <code class="language-java">Collection</code> view of the values contained in this map;</p></li><li><p><code class="language-java">Set&lt;Map.Entry&lt;K, V&gt;&gt; entrySet()</code> returns a <code class="language-java">Set</code> view of the entries (associations) contained in this map.</p></li></ul>
<p>This is not even a complete list of methods since <code class="language-java">Map</code> is a really huge interface. The documentation really helps when using maps.</p>
<p>To start using a map, you need to instantiate one of its implementations: <code class="language-java">HashMap</code>, <code class="language-java">TreeMap</code>, and <code class="language-java">LinkedHashMap</code>. They use different rules for ordering elements and have some additional methods. There are also <strong>immutable</strong> maps.</p>
<h5 id="immutable-maps">Immutable maps</h5>
<p>The simplest way to create a<strong> map</strong> is to invoke the <code class="language-java">of</code> method of the <code class="language-java">Map</code> interface. The method takes zero or any even number of arguments in the format <code class="language-java">key1, value1, key2, value2, ...</code> and returns an <strong>immutable</strong> map.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Map&lt;String, String&gt; emptyMap = Map.of();

Map&lt;String, String&gt; friendPhones = Map.of(
        "Bob", "+1-202-555-0118",
        "James", "+1-202-555-0220",
        "Katy", "+1-202-555-0175"
);</code></pre>
<p>Now let's consider some operations that can be applied to <strong>immutable</strong> maps using our example with <code class="language-java">friendPhones</code>.</p>
<p>The size of a map equals the number of pairs contained in it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println(emptyMap.size());     // 0
System.out.println(friendPhones.size()); // 3</code></pre>
<p>It is possible to get a value from a map by its key:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String bobPhone = friendPhones.get("Bob"); // +1-202-555-0118
String alicePhone = friendPhones.get("Alice"); // null
String phone = friendPhones.getOrDefault("Alex", "Unknown phone"); // Unknown phone</code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p></p><p>Note that the <code class="language-java">getOrDefault</code> method provides a simple way to prevent <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/1945" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a NullPointerException (NPE) is an unchecked exception that occurs when a program attempts to use a variable with a null value as if it were a real object. | This can happen when a reference variable has not been initialized or has had its object reference set to null. NPEs are caused by programming errors and do not need to be declared or handled in the method signature. They are often referred to as NPEs or simply nulls. To avoid NPEs, programmers must ensure that objects are initialized before their use. It's worth noting that the concept of references and the errors associated with them is not unique to Java.">NullPointerException</a></strong> since it avoids <code class="language-java">null</code>'s.</p><p></p></div>
<p></p>
<p>It is also possible to check whether a map contains a particular key or value by using <code class="language-java">containsKey</code> and <code class="language-java">containsValue</code> methods.</p>
<p>We can directly access the set of keys and collection of values from a map:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println(friendPhones.keySet()); // [James, Bob, Katy]
System.out.println(friendPhones.values()); // [+1-202-555-0220, +1-202-555-0118, +1-202-555-0175]</code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning"><p></p><p>Since it is <strong>immutable,</strong> only methods that do not change the elements of this map will work. Others will throw an exception <code class="language-java">UnsupportedOperationException</code>. If you'd like to put or remove elements, use one of <code class="language-java">HashMap</code>, <code class="language-java">TreeMap</code> or <code class="language-java">LinkedHashMap</code>. We will consider them in the next topic.</p><p></p></div>
<p></p>
<h5 id="hashmap">HashMap</h5>
<p>The <code class="language-java">HashMap</code> class represents a map backed by a <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/12379" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a hash table is an implementation of the Map interface that provides fast access to its elements. | It is represented by the HashMap class. Internally, a hash table is organized as an array of buckets, where each bucket is a linked list. Each bucket can hold multiple key-value pairs that have the same hash code. When a key-value pair is added to a hash table, a hash function is applied to the key to determine the index of the bucket where the pair should be stored. If there are no collisions, the time complexity of basic operations such as insertion, retrieval, deletion, and search is constant, i.e., O(1). However, as the table fills up, collisions increase, leading to more table look-ups and lower performance, which can degrade to O(n). To prevent this, the load factor is used to trigger a resizing of the table.">hash table</a></strong>. This implementation provides constant-time performance for <code class="language-java">get</code> and <code class="language-java">put</code> methods assuming the hash function distributes the elements uniformly among the buckets.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>The <code class="language-java">Map</code> interface is one of the most useful and popular features in Java. It implements the idea of an associative array. There are a number of analogues in the real world, such as phone books, dictionaries, and others. <code class="language-java">Map</code> is often treated as a part of collection, although it doesn't inherit the <code class="language-java">Collection</code> interface.
